# Example graph config file
#
# This file can use any extension, just encode in UTF-8 and use lowercase letters only.
#
# To generate a graph with this config, use the command 'gen graph-example.txt'
# in the heap app.
#
# Default values (seen here) are used for omitted parameters.
#
# Numbers cannot have commas or other decoration.
#
# Format: <param> <value>

type        graph       # Required.

name        test-name   # If omitted, defaults to the config filename, in
                        # this case 'graph-example.txt'.

vertices    100000      # Number of vertices.
edges       1000000     # Number of edges. A minimum of vertices - 1 edges
                        # will be used to connect the graph.

minweight   0           # Dijkstra's algorithm only works with non-negative weights.
