# Example heap test config file
#
# This file can use any extension, just encode in UTF-8 and use lowercase letters only.
#
# To generate test data with this config, use the command 'gen heap-example.txt'
# in the heap app.
#
# Default values (seen here) are used for omitted parameters.
#
# Numbers cannot have commas or other decoration.
#
# Format: <param> <value>

                      # this case 'heap-example.txt'.

addfreq   1   # Weight given to add/decrease/pop operations
decfreq   1   # The chance of each operation being chosen is weight / total,
popfreq   1   # but an add operation is forced when the heap is empty.

minval    -1000000000 # Minimum value to store in the heap.
